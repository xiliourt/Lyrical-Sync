[00:01.00] Yo, check the mic
[00:03.60] One two... yeah, that's the sound.
[00:07.90] Fresh from the digital ground.
[00:09.70] Used to slave over beats, days in the lab,
[00:12.40] Now I'm just typing prompts, ain't no time for the drab.
[00:14.80] Got this idea brewing, a rhyme in my head,
[00:17.30] But the budget was tight, nearly left it unsaid.
[00:19.90] Then I found the solution, a light in the dark,
[00:22.70] Gemini Flash, leaving its generative mark.
[00:25.10] Free as a bird, this track ain't costing me a cent,
[00:27.30] Straight from the AI, my new lyrical bent.
[00:29.90] Gemini Flash flow, yeah, you heard what I said,
[00:32.50] Making tracks for zero dough, filling ears instead.
[00:34.90] Australian HipHop, from the land down under,
[00:37.70] AI-powered thunder, no creative blunder.
[00:40.30] Just a few clicks, and the magic unfolds,
[00:43.00] New stories told, as the rhythm controls.
[00:50.00] No more late nights, no more hunting for loops,
[00:52.60] Just a prompt and a vision, busting out the scoops.
[00:55.20] Told it "Aussie vibe," "boom bap," "deep bass line,"
[00:58.00] It cooked up the rhythm, truly divine.
[01:00.10] Female or male vocal? Nah, gave it a choice,
[01:02.40] Said "Male only, thanks," amplifying my voice.
[01:05.20] Wrote the words out, structured it clean,
[01:07.90] The AI stitched it up, a musical machine.
[01:10.20] Gemini Flash flow, yeah, you heard what I said,
[01:12.80] Making tracks for zero dough, filling ears instead.
[01:15.20] Australian HipHop, from the land down under,
[01:18.00] AI-powered thunder, no creative blunder.
[01:20.60] Just a few clicks, and the magic unfolds,
[01:23.10] New stories told, as the rhythm controls.
[01:30.40] Some call it cheating, some call it the future's call,
[01:32.60] I just call it smart, standing ten feet tall.
[01:35.10] The tech is evolving, pushing boundaries far,
[01:37.50] From a text box to a track, a brand new shining star.
[01:40.10] So when you hear this groove, so fresh and so clean,
[01:42.80] Remember the engine, the generative scene.
[01:45.20] Gemini Flash flow, yeah, you heard what I said,
[01:47.60] Making tracks for zero dough, filling ears instead.
[01:50.00] Australian HipHop, from the land down under,
[01:52.80] AI-powered thunder, no creative blunder.
[01:55.50] Just a few clicks, and the magic unfolds,
[01:58.10] New stories told, as the rhythm controls.
[02:03.20] Yeah... for free, mate.
[02:05.20] Gemini Flash
[02:09.10] Suno you done good
[02:14.70] Peace out
